Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement, which  leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination.
Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow movement, making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming, and a patient's steps may become shorter when he walks.

In this analysis I will focus on analysing the gait data as ground reaction force over 
time and try to classify healthy people and those who have Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
